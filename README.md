# SFMLEngine
This is a very rudamentary SFML graphics engine, written in C++ from scratch, which includes a pipeline system for rendering, updates and event handlng.
With the pipeline system it is also possible to create layering systems and groups. The engine also includes a callback
logic (e.g. for button clicks) to custom handler functions.
The interactable objects are created using an inheritance system where the properties of objects are assigned through (virtual) inheritance.
An example usage of the engine is included in the "Implementation" folder.
